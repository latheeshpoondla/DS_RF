# :deciduous_tree: Decision Tree and Random Forest :evergreen_tree::evergreen_tree: implementation from scratch
This project contains **from-scratch implementations** of both **Decision Tree Classifier** and **Random Forest Classifier** using only python, pandas, numpy.
The model is tested with titanic dataset and compared with sklearn's model.

## Features

- 🧠 Decision Tree built using Gini Impurity
- 🌲 Random Forest using bagging and multiple trees
- 📊 Accuracy comparison with Scikit learn
- ⚙️ No external ML libraies (only, numpy + pandas)
- 🔣 Handles only numerical, categories can be encoded and trained

|Model  |Accuracy|
|------|-------|
|Custom Decision Tree|78.77%|
|Sklearn Decision Tree|79.33%|
|Custom Random Forest| -- |
